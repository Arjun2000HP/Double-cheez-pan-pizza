Grease a baking dish/pan with some butter and spread the dough. Add the pasta sauce and spread it on all of the dough's surface. Lay the pieces of the turkey slices.
 Add both cheeses and finally lay the peppers slices on top.
Preheat the oven at 200 degrees Celsius / 390 Fahrenheit (using top and bottom heating -no fan). 
When hot, reduce the heat to 180 degrees Celsius / 350 Fahrenheit and place the dish in the oven for 20-25 minutes in the middle rack. 
Once the cheese starts getting golden take the pizza out of the oven. Enjoy!

You can also use some baking paper on your pan instead of greasing with butter. 
Simply place some paper on the pan and put the dough on top.
 The key ingredient in this recipe is the dough. 
You can choose a thin or deep-dish pizza dough. You can also select any pasta sauce or other ingredients.
